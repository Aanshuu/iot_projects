# iot_projects
These are all sort of projects I worked on raspberrypi.
Each of them are diffrent and some of the files are linked too.
coap_dht.py and coapclient.py should be run together.
index.html is the webpage for websocket.py, therefore should be working together.
Use dbms.py and raspi_mqtt.ino together, the database receives data from raspi_mqtt.ino.
Once you have setup your firebase, use firebaseDHT11.py to get temperature and humidity values and once you have linked you firebase with this file you can see values getting stored.
rest_api3.py for using and understading how rest api works.
