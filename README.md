# iot_projects <br>
These are all sort of projects I worked on raspberrypi. <br>
Each of them are diffrent and some of the files are linked too.<br>
coap_dht.py and coapclient.py should be run together.<br>
index.html is the webpage for websocket.py, therefore should be working together.<br>
Use dbms.py and raspi_mqtt.ino together, the database receives data from raspi_mqtt.ino.<br>
Once you have setup your firebase, use firebaseDHT11.py to get temperature and humidity values and once you have linked you firebase with this file you can see values getting stored.<br>
rest_api3.py for using and understading how rest api works.<br>
